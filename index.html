                <h2>Why did I want to join Code Nation?</h2>
                <p>
                        When I started researching a career in software development, I quickly realised I needed to
                        upgrade and
                        re-evaluate my skillset to encompass some coding development.
                        <br>
                        During my research I came across various
                        coding schools across the North West. Code Nation was the most valuable in terms of success
                        rates,
                        learning objectives and future career prospects. As I was completely new to coding and had not
                        been in a
                        learning environment for a number of years, I was encouraged to see Code Nation giving people
                        from any
                        background the opportunity to develop the skills for a career in software development.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I was really
                        excited by the positive and fun atmosphere on the campus and that everyone was so professional.

                <h2> Why am I interested in Tech and Coding? </h2>
                <p>
                        From the day I saved all my pocket money to buy a Sega Master System II in 1990, I have had a
                        huge
                        passion for computers and gaming. I continued this interest through to a career as an IT
                        Analyst. During
                        this time I found it was not enough for me to just triage the IT problems, I wanted to learn why
                        the
                        computers had issues to begin with. I love problem solving and get immense satisfaction from
                        getting a
                        solution. From talking to a friend who is a developer, I started to think about coding and being
                        able to
                        develop my own games and websites. Now I have the opportunity to follow this dream I hope to
                        continue
                        into an apprenticeship with Code Nation, and onto a career in development or programming.

                <h2>Purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
                <p>
                        Businesses nowadays use IT more than ever before. From faster payments in their apps, to their
                        technology infrastructure, they will be using IT every single day, and not just within working
                        hours. With the rise of apps and the online consumer sector, businesses have
                        had to change the way they provide their services to accommodate a 24 hour culture. For
                        businesses to survive in this fast paced modern climate they need to put themselves above the
                        competition. From a technology point of view one way of doing this is advertising their services
                        online to as many consumers as possible as quickly as possible. This ease of communication
                        between the business and customer reduces advertising costs and increases exposure dramatically
                        compared to alternative methods.
                        The use of global IT communications has enabled businesses to work remotely, from skype for
                        meetings to emails and cloud sharing of documents. This allows every aspect of the business to
                        keep up to date with the latest changes and ideas. Online and cloud storage and the increase in
                        hard drive space has reduced the amount of physical documentation a company must store which
                        removes the need for large office spaces therefore reducing business running costs yet again.

                <h2>Methods, skills and resources needed to complete a digital project successfully</h2>
                <p>
                        In order to run a successful digital project you will need to utilise a number of resources,
                        planning methods and team skillsets.

                        Methods:
                        <p>
                                Planning for the project is a high priority for the project manager and the team
                                as a whole. The use of online project management tools such as Trello and Slack
                                are a good starting place to set up the planning process. After the details have
                                been decided on there are a number of steps to completion. These include
                                creation of the website (e.g. HTML code and CSS design), review by the team,
                                testing by internal and external users, deployment, customer feedback, and
                                finally, ongoing maintenance for any issues not picked up in testing, including
                                bugs and fixes. This is not an exhaustive list as issues may arise that mean you
                                need to re-evaluate the plan and adjust the timescale to completion.
                        </p>

                        Skills:
                        <p>
                                The team skills required for the project will need to align with the timescales,
                                functionality, overall design, and target audience of the website. Most digital
                                project
                                teams will have a project manager, developers, designers, testing team,
                                deployment and
                                maintenance teams.
                        </p>
                        An experienced project manager can help ensure that the project is successful even when
                        challenges arise. They will guide every step of the process within its scope, schedule
                        and
                        budget. Ideally a PM will have a skillset which includes; excellent communication;
                        attention to
                        detail; high level organisation; assertiveness (but fair); critical thinking; and be
                        able to
                        control risk.
                        <p>
                                The development and design teams will need to be experienced in the code you
                                want your
                                website to be written in, e.g. HTML, CSS, Javascript and the tools used to
                                create this
                                code, e.g. Visual Basic Code. Cohesion and competency are a high priority when
                                choosing
                                the team to develop the project.
                        </p>
                        Resources:
                        <p>
                                Whichever resources are decided upon, the team should be proficient and
                                consistent in
                                using them.
                                For all teams across the project, Trello, Slack and GitHub are useful for
                                collaboration
                                and communication, especially when there are changes or issues that have arisen.
                                There
                                should also be enough hardware/software resources for each team member to
                                effectively
                                carry out the tasks that have been assigned to them.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Plan and carry out tasks using IT e.g. making website</h2>
                        <p>
                                I will start to plan my website design with the Trello board tool. Each task will be
                                assigned to a new
                                card starting with the basics "To do", "Doing", "Done" with new cards added during the
                                project.
                                Please see the link below for my Trello board.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                <a id="Trello" href="https://trello.com/b/eJPGWIJu/html-assignments">Trello Board</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                After the main planning on Trello, I am going to follow this simple list:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                                <li>Write website content in the Visual Basic Code program using HTML.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Complete the design of the website using CSS.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Testing and review.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Amendments and tweeks to the layout, design and text if required.</li>
                                <br>
                                <li>Second testing if any issues.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                                Again, this list is not an exhaustive set of steps I will follow, but as I have not
                                completed then project yet I cannot provide a full list.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Describe risks that may impact digital projects</h2>
                        <p>
                                There are many risks that may be encountered on projects whether digital or not, and it
                                is rare projects
                                will go through to completion under ideal circumstances. For digital projects we can see
                                some specific
                                issues that may arise due to the amount of technology and costs involved.
                        </p>
                        Technology risks:

                        <ul>
                                <li>Hardware - Costly for initial layout and continuing maintenance. Is the team
                                        proficient in this
                                        using the hardware provided?</li>
                                <li>Software - Conflicting versions of OS if new ones are released during the project.
                                        Programmes may
                                        not be sufficient for your needs. Are your teams able to use the programmes you
                                        need them to in
                                        order to complete their tasks efficiently?</li>
                                <li>Skills - Are there any training requirements for any area of the project?</li>
                                <li>People issues - Depending on the scale of the project there may be a large amount of
                                        people in the
                                        team. This may lead to communication, personality, and consistency issues. Team
                                        members may
                                        leave or join the project throwing the skillset and dynamics out of sync.</li>
                                <li>Budgeting/Costs - Cost of digital projects are generally high due to sector trends
                                        and expectations
                                        of businesses and consumers to have the latest tech. Keeping within a budget may
                                        be difficult if
                                        problems arise with upgrading hardware/software or there are unavoidable
                                        external factors, e.g.
                                        flooding in the building that houses the project.</li>
                                <li>Competition - Competitors may release a similar website before you, putting your
                                        project into
                                        uncertainty, and could also draw away potential customers.</li>
                                <li>Planning - Risks may not have been sufficiently thought out during the planning
                                        process giving a
                                        'best case scenario'. This can lead to unexpected issues that take valuable
                                        resource and cost
                                        away from the project and affect the timeline.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                                All of these factors and many more can lead to the failure of a digital project. The
                                main theme to take
                                away from this is plan plan plan! Then plan some more!
                        </p>
                        <h2>How would I select/use IT systems and software?</h2>
                        <p>
                                When selecting which IT systems and software to use for my website I started by looking
                                at my end goal.
                                What did I want the website to look like? How did I want to navigate around it? Who were
                                my target
                                audience? From this point I could look at the functionality of the software available to
                                me, my current
                                skill set and if these were compatible enough for me to complete my project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Most software used to create a website is cross-platform (except xcode which is Apple
                                specific) and can
                                be used with Mac, Windows and linux. I decided to use Visual Studio Code to write the
                                HTML code and CSS
                                to style and layout the web pages.

                        <p>
                                I have found Trello extremely useful as a planning tool during my project execution. The
                                layout and
                                functionalities are easy to use and visually appealing, allowing me to add and move
                                cards around the
                                board quickly. As this is an individual project I have not had a team to share my Trello
                                board with but
                                I have done this for previous projects. Using Trello for team planning increases its
                                functionality as it
                                can be linked to other tools like Slack, allowing team members to be instantly updated
                                on any changes
                                made to the Trello board.
                        </p>
                        In a team scenario we can also use GitHub for version control and collaboration between the
                        developers. It
                        enables them to work together on projects and as it is online they can access the platform from
                        anywhere. Git is
                        the revision control system to manage your code history, whereas GitHub is the hosting service
                        for the Git tool.
                        Git allows you to store and track changes to your source code. It will show any changes that are
                        made to that
                        source code by any member of the team that has access. From a project perspective this is useful
                        as there is a
                        record of every version of the code if it needs to be reviewed at any point.
                </p>
                <h2>Legal guidelines and restraints that impact digital projects e.g. GDPR</h2>
                <p>
                        GDPR allows users more control over how much of their personal data is stored and used by
                        companies,
                        giving them access to view, restrict or even delete the information held. This was brought about
                        by the
                        advancements of technology and global business giving rise to increased availability and use of
                        personal
                        data. Essentially they cannot hold data that they "may need for future". If companies do not
                        adhere to
                        these guidelines they can get sanctioned.
                </p>
                For digital projects we need to take this into account, to minimise the amount of personal data
                collected by
                limiting the scope for collecting this in the first place. This will also mean amending the website to
                ask for
                consent to use someones data. To this end, developers and designers on a project will need to understand
                basic
                GDPR and know what elements should be implemented to be compliant.

                <h2>Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
                <p>
                        There a number of constraints you may encounter when developing a website:
                        <ul>
                                <li>Copyright issues</li>
                                <li>Domain Name selection</li>
                                <li>Trademark concerns</li>
                                <li>Defamation</li>
                        </ul>
                        In this section our main focus will be copyright issues faced when developing and designing
                        websites. Copyright is the legal protection of original works of authorship, and is
                        automatically attributed, e.g. creating original music, literature, artistic works (e.g.
                        illustrations), non-literary works (e.g. websites, software, web content), sound/music/TV/film
                        recordings.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Copyright prevents people from:
                        <ul>
                                <li>Copying work</li>
                                <li>Distributing work</li>
                                <li>Renting copies</li>
                                <li>Performing/showing/playing work in public</li>
                                <li>Putting it on the internet</li>
                        </ul>
                        In most countries copyright lasts a minimum of life of the creator plus 50 years. This is
                        dependant on the type of content they have created and the time at which it was originally
                        copywritten.
                </p>
                <h2>Access issues - issues disabled people may face when using webpages, how to overcome them</h2>
                <p>
                        It is estimated that around 20% of people in the UK find it difficult to use technology because
                        of a disability. As technology has advanced rapidly within the last few years, there is now a
                        number of adaptations that they can take advantage of to get close and even full functionality
                        of a website. There are a number of charities like Able Gamers, to name just one, that use a
                        combination of technologies, e.g. mouth controllers and eye gaze (not an exhaustive list), that
                        help people play computer games whatever their disability. We will look at the main disabilities
                        and how technology can be adapted for them.
                        <ul>
                                <li>Blindness - Text-to-Braille or Text-to-Speech software. HTML can provide the text
                                        equivalent to visual information.</li>
                                <li>Poor eyesight/Colour blindness - Text and images can be enlarged, screen enlargers
                                        can be added externally. For colour blindness, links can be
                                        underlined/enboldened/colourised/patterned simultaneously for clarity even when
                                        the material is shown in colours. Using an "alt" text in HTML to describe an
                                        image and dark text over light backgrounds can help also.</li>
                                <li>Mobility disabilities - Navigation is a difficulty for people with loss of motor
                                        skills, tremors, lowered use of hands etc. Coding in a specific way can allow
                                        access and navigation via keyboard only or "single switch device" (e.g.
                                        joystick).</li>
                                <li>Hearing impairment/deafness - Although the web is generally a visual media, there is
                                        information to be gained via audio formats. The use of closed captions or sign
                                        language can help people with hearing difficulties or deafness to receive the
                                        same information as people with no hearing impairmemts.</li>
                                <li>Photosensitive seizures/Epilepsy - Seizures can be triggered by flashing effects.
                                        Although they improve the visual appeal of the website, the option to switch
                                        them off and a disclaimer for the flashing images must be added to the website.
                                </li>
                                <li>Cognitive/Intellectual disabilities - e.g. dementia, dyslexia. Due to the complexity
                                        of website design or its content, people with cognitive disablities often find
                                        it difficult to understand the information provided. As well as making the
                                        content simple and easy to use, being consistent in colour, text font,
                                        navigation and colour contrast can be valid solutions for cognitive impairment.
                                </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                                Improving accessibility to technology ensures that your website is open to everyone. As
                                well as expanding the potential audience, it can improve the overall design and
                                usability for all users, making it more flexible and futureproof.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
                        <p>
                                When viewing websites there are a number of file types that will be encountered, some
                                more frequently than others. In this section we will look at the most common.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>.JPG/.JPEG - Common image format mainly used for photos.</li>
                                <li>.GIF - Most common. Can be animated. Can be interlaced, saves the graphic so it
                                        loads progressively.</li>
                                <li>.PNG - Designed for use in place of GIF's. Better version of GIF, except for
                                        animation.</li>
                                <li>.AVI - Standard video format. Cannot stream so file needs to be downloaded to view.
                                </li>
                                <li>.MPEG/.MPG - Streams movies.</li>
                                <li>.MOV/.QT - QuickTime format for streaming movies.</li>
                                <li>.DOC - Microsoft Word Document. Most popular word proccesing tool. </li>
                                <li>.PDF - Adobe Acrobat files. Allows documents to be transferred between computers and
                                        platforms without changing the format or layout.</li>
                                <li>.TXT - Most basic of file types, i.e. text files from Notepad, Notes etc.</li>
                                <li>.EXE - Executable file. Format of programmes that require installation.</li>
                                <li>.MIDI - Music files normally made on keyboards. Very small in size and have good
                                        sound.</li>
                                <li>.MP3 - Compressed files making them easily downloaded. Good quality sound.</li>
                                <li>.WAV - Basic sound file for short samples.</li>
                                <li>.CSS - Used to make website look good. Describes the style of HTML and how it should
                                        be displayed. Can be initially written and edited in a text file then
                                        transferred. CSS can save a lot of work and can control the layout of multiple
                                        webpages at once.</li>
                                <li>.HTML - Creates the structure of webpages. Uses elements and tags to format the HTML
                                        content.</li>
                                <li>.ZIP - Different types of files that can compressed and archived. A program must be
                                        used to 'unzip' them, e.g. WinZip.</li>
                                <li>.RAR - Similar to .ZIP files but supports multimedia compression. WinRAR can be used
                                        to open the files.</li>
                        </ul>
                        As you can see there are a lot of different types of files to make your website as interesting
                        and attractive as you want. Ultimately it will be dependant on what your website theme is and
                        who your target audience is.

        <h1 id="review">Review</h1>

        </p>
        <h2>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - are you happy with the tools used?</h2>
        <p>
                The IT tools I used were Visual Studio Code to write the HTML and CSS code, and Trello for the planning
                of my project. I enjoyed learning these new tools as we used them for some Javascript earlier in the
                course. In the future I may find different programmes that would suit the creation of a blog better.
        </p>

        <h2>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
        <p>
                As these are the first programmes I have used for coding, I would not be able to compare against others.
                For my purposes they were easy to use and suitable for my project.
                Visual Studio Code was simple to navigate and a good starting point for my first coding experience.
                Trello is a valuable resourse whatever the project size.
        </p>
        <h2>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of the final project</h2>
        <p>
                Overall the whole experience of building this project has been exciting but challenging. I am generally
                happy with the content of my website but I would have liked to spend more time on the aesthetics of the
                page, like adding some images and other types of files and learning more formatting techniques. Apart
                from these changes, I am excited to see that it works as intended.
                <ul>
                        <li>Strengths:</li>
                        <ul>
                                <li>Planning - Using Trello made this process very easy although I could have broken the
                                        steps down even further than I did. Although I am an organised person it was
                                        still useful to see what I had to do, and also add any issues that arose so I
                                        could look back and resolve them. </li>
                                <li>Writing HTML and CSS code - I found that this was a strength of mine as I understood
                                        them and could relate any changes I made to the visual look of the website. I
                                        would like to learn these at a more advanced level in the future.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <li>Weaknesses:</li>
                        <ul>
                                <li>Design and layout - I could have spent alot more time on this aspect of the project,
                                        but due to skill and time limitations I am unhappy with the final look. </li>
                                <li>Skillset - I found this to be a weakness as I have not used HTML or CSS before this
                                        project. Although, I found this part thoroughly rewarding to complete.</li>

        <h2>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
        <p>
                The main ways I would improve my project is by spending more time on the design and layout of the
                webpage. To do this I could have made the navigation buttons more prominent to ensure usability. I would
                have also thought about a heirarchy of important areas to make this content more visible, together with
                keeping the format simple yet distinct. Using more graphics and images was the intention but with the
                time constraints this was difficult to achieve to at a satisfactory level.

        <h2>Review of the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems in terms of productivity and efficiency</h2>
        <p>
                I have reviewed this in terms of the tools I have used on this project, i.e. Trello, Visual Studio Code,
                GitHub and Slack.
                <ul>
                        <li>Benefits: </li>
                        <ul>
                                <li>Trello - Increased my efficiency by saving time with the planning process. Allowed
                                        me to keep up to date with each stage, I could see quickly what needed to be
                                        done and easily move tasks around.</li>
                                <li>Visual Studio Code - With this programme I could keep HTML, CSS and Javascript files
                                        in one folder so they are easily accessible when working on them simultaneously.
                                        I liked the format document option and that colour of the syntax can be changed
                                        to something easier to view.
                                </li>
                                <li>GitHub - Allowed me to upload code and quickly see any changes to previous versions
                                        to determine any issues that have occurred. Also allows efficiency when working
                                        in a team as all team members can view the code and contribute to the project
                                        easily.</li>
                        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
                <li>Drawbacks:</li>
                <ul>
                        <li>Trello - In terms of my solo project I could have used this more to my
                                advantage. I am still getting used to the functionality.</li>
                        <li>Slack - I did not use this for my solo project, I think it is more useful if
                                you are working in a team.</li>
                        <li>GitHub - I had to learn how to use GitHub which decreased my efficiency and
                                productivity with using it.</li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ways to improve efficiency and productivity</h2>
        <p>
                Efficiency:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>Limit interruptions - ensure your working environment has minimal disturbance.</li>
                <li>Use task management software - e.g. Trello. </li>
                <li>Keep tasks simple - break them down into the smallest parts.</li>
                <li>Don't work long hours - shorter working days are generally more efficient as they increase
                        productivity. </li>
                <li>Work in a team - Team work improves efficiency as tasks can be split between the group dependant on
                        skillsets.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
                Productivity:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>Listen to music - music you like is known to improve productivity in the workplace.</li>
                <li>One task at a time - Completing one task at a time instead of multi-tasking allows for quality over
                        quantity output. Small tasks also gives a sense of achievement and keeps you moving to the next
                        task.</li>
                <li>Remove distractions - Finding somewhere comfortable and quiet can help optimise productivity.</li>
                <li>Take regular breaks - This increases both productivity and efficiency, especially when working with
                        computers. It can be determiental to health to look at monitors for long periods of time. </li>
                <li>Don't work late - productivity decreases if you do not take anything in after a certain amount of
                        time. Start early rather than stay late.</li>
                <li>Don't give up - If facing a difficult task it is better to take a break and come back to it rather
                        than give up.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Develop solutions to improve my own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>
        <p>
                Overall I believe my productivity was mostly on par with my peers in the group. When I found that I
                could not carry on with any coding practice on the computer at home, I started to use my commute to
                research coding and write notes on the project. This meant I only had to write them up on the computer
                when I got into the class. However, my efficiency would have increased with more coding practice,
                allowing me to complete tasks quicker as I became more proficient.
                Also, although I learn new skills quickly I feel I was a bit slower than normal due to being out of
                education for a few years. I had to learn how to use a Mac which took a couple of days of
                navigation, as I had only used Windows before.
                Team working would have been useful to complete this project given the extent of my skillset. It is
                always useful to have input from other sources, especially given the time limitations of this project.
        </p>
        <h2>How to test digital solutions</h2>
        <p>
                Does my website work?
        </p>
        <p>
                Yes! I have to tested it on different web browsers, for this project Chrome and Safari. In a wider
                project cross browser testing is used to test across multiple browsers. This checks for compatibility on
                different web browsers, e.g. Edge, Safari, Chrome.
        </p>
        There are a number of digital testing methods employed by developers to ensure that their software application
        works as intended upon release.
        <p>
                <ol>
                        <li>Unit testing:
                                <br>
                                Unit testing allows individual units of software to be tested. A unit is the smallest
                                component that can be tested. Within programming, a unit could be a programme, function,
                                procedure etc. The aim of unit testing is to isolate each component of the subject code,
                                (e.g. programme, website etc) from the rest of the code and determine if it works as
                                expected. This is usually done during development of the software application by the
                                developers.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Integration Testing:
                                <br>
                                This checks if all components of the unit testing are working together. After the units
                                are combined again, it will expose any faults when the units interact with each other
                                and are tested as a group.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>System testing:
                                <br>
                                Completed when the complete integrated software is to be tested as a whole. It evaluates
                                the systems compliance with the requirements specified.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>User testing:
                                <br>
                                Also known as UAT (User Acceptance Testing), is tested in a real world, typically by end
                                users (clients) that would be using the application. </li>
                        <br>
                        For this project I will carry out unit testing and user testing. The unit testing I have done as
                        I have been writing the code to check that my web page has the content I have written. For the
                        user testing part I will ask my peers to use it as a website and address any bugs they may come
                        up with.
